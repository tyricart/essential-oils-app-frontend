<h2>Visiting My Captain & Coding Lab</h2>
<h5>21 June 2022</h5>
<div class=""></div>
<p>Today was an amazing day! It started off unrushed and easy, unlike when I have to get my daughter ready for school. Those mornings are full of to-do's to get her out the door that I really don't have the opportunity to take things slow and focus solely on myself. I began the day with a short but concentrated meditation which helped me start off centered. Afterwards <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> did dishes, picked up laundrey, made celery juice and sat at my desk to attend my weekly department meeting. <br> <br>
After the meeting I received a call from a colleague to confirm we would be headed North to visit with one of our managed yachts. On the drive up I was doing the typical remote work thing... checking emails on my phone, making international calls and creating a plan for how our visit with the captain and crew would play out. The captain had no idea I was coming and even when I was on the phone with him on our drive up, I played like I was at home. Right before we got to the marina I called him to say my colleague needed him to open the gate but that she couldn't call because she was busy. He later confessed he found it odd but agreed anyway. <br><br>
When we arrived at the gate she said "That's him". He recognized her car as we got closer and flagged her down as I lowered the window. I said "Hi Captain!" and he said "What are you doing here?" with a confused smile. The Chief Stewardess was arriving with lunch just as we got out the car and also had no idea I would be making a surpise visit. Having never seen me before, she carried on gathering the lunch pick up as we approached. I called out to her and said "Hola Carolina, I'm so proud of you!" She nearly cried, she instantly knew my voice and was so happy and shoked to finally see me in person after almost two and a half years of being in contact. Over the years she's been promoted twice to the highest interior position due to her amazing work ething and pleasant demeanor. <br><br>
There was all sorts of introductions, pleasantries and banter as we made our way onboard. We sat down in one of the living area's to discuss progress of a repair needed in order to get the vessel ready for an upcoming charter. Fortunately the work has been completed and the yacht will be ready for departure on time. We moved on to the helm to run down our list of important items, fortunately everything had been actioned or completed so that part of the meeting was short. We receievd a tour of the yacht which of course was lovely despite having recently finished work. I ran into the Chief Engineer, the longest employeed crew member and gave him a hug. The captain was getting hungry and so we made it off the yacht and on to a nearby restaurant named BrickTops. <br><br>
Lunch was amazing mainly because of the company. It's not often I have the opportunity to genuinly connect with my captain and crew. Not because we don't want to but rather because they're usually traveling and I'm usually stuck behind a computer. Today was very special because I got to see the hospitable and considerate side of my captain where I normally get the direct and aloof version only. Again not because we can't or don't want to connect but rather because of the demands of paperwork, emails and business of running a super-yacht. <br><br>
The food was amazing and we saved room for dessert and decafe coffee. We waited for valet and our captain gave us directions for a scenic route to further enjoy our time in West Palm Beach. On the drive home my colleague and I went on and on about what a great visit that was and how he set the bar really high for the next captain that takes us to lunch, lol. Once home I rushed to set up my laptop, I hadn't access to the internet all morning and could see the emails coming in from my phone. I got straight to work on responding and putting out fires. Before I knew it I had 10 minutes to switch from my work laptop to my class laptop. <br><br>
Like I said early, today was an amazing day and labs was definitely the icing on the cake. I'm not sure if it was because the concepts are starting to cement themselves in my mind or because Juan questionable color scheme choice and technical difficults had us all laughing. In either case, it was really nice to end my day feeling good about what I'm learning with people I enjoy being around. At one point towards the end of our lab, Juan realized that although the code was rendering an answer, it wasn't producing correct inforation, meaning something was incorrect with the function. We were tired and it was almost time to wrap up so we just let it go for the night. I however was determined to get an accurate results. Once we said good night I continued to look at the code to crack the error... I got it!!! I fixed the error and shared it with a few of my classmates as I wanted all of us to get it right. And that is how I ended my night, well actually creating this blog post is how I am ending my night but you get what I'm saying. <br><br>

<h2>Coding Clocks & Countdowns</h2>
<h5>22 June 2022</h5>
<div class=""></div>
<p>Today I started my day with a list of what I’m grateful for. I’ll be honest and say that I don’t do it often enough but when I do it helps to make sure I stay on the bright side of my day. Yacht management was uneventful today but busy nonetheless. I spent my morning chasing new crew for documents needed to create their employment contracts, boring. <br><br>
    The highlight of my day was when I took a break from my computer to go up to Boca Code and listen in on the graduating cohorts final project presentations. I didn’t get to see everyone present but the few that I did see were very impressive. One in particular was an app for coparenting. Without giving all the details away or doing it injustice I will say that it’s a communication app specifically guided to <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">resolve the issues of interacting with someone you share a child with whether it be biological child or foster child. <br><br>
    This particular application really resonated with me because I have a close family member who would greatly benefit from this application. After the presentations we mingled and I met with some of the students I didn’t get to see present and learned about their projects. I was impressed by how thoughtful these new software engineers were in creating solutions that were important to them and beneficial to all of us. <br><br>
    After the presentations and the mingling I came home to get ready for my class. Today we had Ahmed presenting with Jino as an Assistant instructor. Sebastian a recent graduate was also there as an assistant instructor. The project for today was to create a digital clock and it wasn’t as easy as it sounds. We got broken into small groups and had to render the countdown on the screen. We later had to do a. countdown which proved to be a little more difficult as it involved math and not just coding. <br><br>
    I'll be honest and say I cheated to figure out the countdown. I googled the answer and was able to have a clock moving forward with a countdown to a specific date just underneath. I say it's cheating because I'm still learning to create the functions and connect what the function can do on my own. In any case, the class was fun and I laughed the entire time we were doing the countdown. I'm reminding myself to enjoy learning, even if I don't understand. To enjoy the company of my class mates and instructors and to look up solutions online. Pretty much all my instructors said looking up solutions online was not cheating but finding resources and getting the work done. So basically it's equally important to know how to code as it is to find the answers when you don't know what to code. <br><br>
    That's another thing I'm really loving about becoming a Software Engineer, team work. First I love critical thinking, problem solving, helping others. Then I LOVE working with others, not all the time but for portions of the work day it's good to come together and think as a unit. I imagine working on something new and amazing, dreaming up concepts of how it's going to manifest and then breaking the group so each of us can do our individual share. That's just me... dreaming of my future career. </p>

    <h2>The Microwave & Girl Talks</h2>
    <h5>23 June 2022</h5>
    <div class=""></div>
    <p>Today really started yesterday! On days I have to drive to Miami Beach I have to prepare the night before... mentally and physically. See I live in Coconut Creek and work in Miami Beach Marina. On a good day during summer break when kids don't go to school, families go on vacation and most the crazy drivers are somewhere else it takes me about 45 minutes to an hour to get to work. Come fall through late spring it takes me two hours each way, easy. It's a nightmare but fortunately I only need to do that twice a week, sometimes only once. <br><br>
        Anyway, our office microwave broke and the remote office manager in Los Angeles ordered one online to be delivered to my house. Ever since COVID, getting packages delivered to our office has become tricky. There's no one at the front desk to receive packages and for a decent amount of time there was no one in the office at all. Me being the thoughtful amazing person that I am, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> offered to have the microwave delivered to my house to ensure it wasn't lost in the mail. Now I'm sure the ROM had good intentions when she bought the biggest most expense microwave Best Buy had available but it was easily the worst option. This thing was HUGE!!! When we asked for the microwave, my office colleague's and I talked about getting one ourselves (we knew the delivery would be a mess) and we only needed a rinky-dinky from Walmart, $60 bucks at best. Well no, that's not what we got... well let me back up and tell you the dilemma with delivery and then tell you about getting it returned. <br><br>
        First of all, it was so big and expensive it couldn't be left at the front door. Someone had to be home to sign for it, Best Buy didn't want anyone claiming they didn't get their expensive microwave you know. Anyway, I wasn't home and had to call a few neighbors to see who could help sign for this thing. Mind you, I had never seen it and was confused as to why it was so important someone sign. I get to my neighbors and knock on her door, the poor girl could hardly open up, it took up her whole doorway. It took two men to bring it up and two men to bring it down. This was a commercial grade, industrial type monster. I immediately knew there would be no way of fitting this thing in the kitchen and now I had to figure out how to get it in my car... by myself! I didn't want to ask my neighbor for any more favors. So this is why I say my day started yesterday. I had to drag (don't tell Best Buy) this microwave from my front door to my cars trunk. I managed. <br><br>
        Fast-forward to today. I start with prayer, meditation and thanksgiving!!!! So nice! My lunch was set apart from the night before, my cloths are laid out like a good responsible adult and the microwave is in the truck. I'm off to Miami Beach. Nothing to report from Yacht Management except payroll is a stressful mess right now. This too shall pass. Highlight is one of my colleagues walking into our department to get a head count for the mandatory fun factory at X-treme Action Park for go-cart racing next week!!!! Our CEO in London has implemented a corporate fun policy... literally mandatory fun at least once a month. I want to get the microwave returned and myself up the road before traffic starts to I leave for Best Buy shortly after lunch. In my rush to get out and beat traffic, I left my work phone (with the return confirmation) at my desk. I gotta give it to Best Buy though, they took the behemoth thing back without a receipt, just a phone number and name. Sweet. <br><br>
        Now I'm off to the races on I-95 to pick up my ex's mom. She's back from New York and keeping me company while my mom and daughter are in Mexico. I really enjoy her company and we had a good heart to heart about what's going on in our lives (mostly mine). We get home and she settles in by watering my mother's plants. She's so thoughtful and I appreciate the little big things like that. I snack on carrots as we start our coding lab. It was all girls today and I loved it. It was so nice to see what everyone is doing, learn from each others strengths and talk about everything... including our thoughts for our final projects. Next week is the start of our second month in class. It's amazing how fast time has flown by and even more amazing is what we are accomplishing as Software Engineers. <br><br>

<h2>TGIF</h2>
<h5>24 June 2022</h5>
<div class=""></div>
<p>Today's blog will be short since it's been a long week. Soooo.... London has insisted we hand over all administrative responsibilities to Guernsey and the captains. They've instructed me to step back and just oversee things to ensure they're done correctly. As much as I enjoy sitting back and getting paid to do as little as possible, this is not what's best for the captains, crew or crew administrators in Guernsey. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> <br><br>
    I have a few captains that are hip to computers but I have others that barely respond to texts. Plus Guernsey has a huge employee turnover due to stress and small employable population. My point is they need to determine what's best for each captain instead of making a blank policy for all of them. I don't want to stress Guernsey with all the demands that are typical of my position and then have them quit which often happens to those working there. Plus this transition period makes for a lot of mistakes which in turn result in delays and frustrations. <br><br>
    This Russia situation has already caused bank hold ups and you want to add fund tracing, contract drafts, and captain chasing??? Ummmm, let's think about this. And that's only half the equations because now they want captains to complete salary sheets when they can barely keep up with crew time off? It's the only thing they have to keep me abreast on and they can hardly do that. No offense but really they have much more important things to do. <br><br>
    This week alone I had three terminated crew dispute their end of contract letters. And I have to cross my figures all goes well for the yacht that ended our services. Monday is the 27th which means we have absolutely no time left to get them all paid by the end of the month. Wires have to be received and sent out the same day to make it to crew's bank accounts on or before the end of the month. <br><br>
    And don't forget there's a 5 hour time difference between Miami and London which means by the time my day get's started they're ready to leave. t was especially evident today when I didn't get more than 10 emails on a Friday at the end of busy pay cycle. Some crew administers even took time off? That blows my mind... how do you leave work at the peak of demand? Whatever, there's only so much I can do and they insist I do less. Weird. <br><br>
    They definitely have a different work ethic in Europe compared to America and it makes me wonder, are they lazy or are we overworked? Maybe it's both. I read an article saying several European companies are switching to 4 day work weeks as a 6 month trial. My company wasn't on the list but if feels like they're unofficially implementing the practice. <br><br>
    This gave me the opportunity to get away and not be worried I'd miss something since nothing was really happening. I took Shelley to Fern Forrest and walked the trails, did a little grocery shopping and came home to get ready for class. Today's lecture showed us how to tap into API's to pull information off the database. I like it... I can follow along 89% of the time and then right at the end Jonathan pick up the pace and I loose it... I'm left in the dust. I laugh when he runs right past me. No sense in getting upset or discouraged. I might not get it right now but I'll get it tomorrow, or the next day. Most importantly I like learning this and I'm excited to make it my career.</span></p>
